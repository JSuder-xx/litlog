# Development To Do Items

- Validate rules for
  - arity mismatch between relations. Invariant condition: All references to relations of name N have arity A.
- Edit Rules after adding them.
- Improved workflow for switching between adding/editing rules and querying. It is too heavy right now.
- Styling cleanup
- When query execution is complete, return to query editing with the previously typed query (in the likely case where the query author wishes to modify the prior query)
